                        Redland librdf Language Bindings

[1]Dave Beckett

Overview

   [2]Redland librdf is a library that provides a high-level interface for
   the Resource Description Framework (RDF) allowing the RDF graph to be
   parsed from XML, stored, queried and manipulated. Redland implements
   each of the RDF concepts in its own class via an object based API,
   reflected into the language APIs, currently Perl, PHP, Python and Ruby.
   Several classes providing functionality such as for parsers, storage
   are built as modules that can be loaded at compile or run-time as
   required.

   The Redland librdf language bindings provides the higher level language
   APIs to Redland in the following languages.
     * Lua (experimental)
     * [3]Perl
     * [4]PHP
     * [5]Python
     * [6]Ruby
